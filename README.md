# Adders
### - Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)
#### CLA computers the Cout of K-bit blocks using generate and propagate signals (Ci+1). This type of adders is mainly used to reduce the delay due to the propagation in order to calculate the carry out.

#### The simulation was done on Modelsim and here is a screenshot with the output:

#### <hr/>
### - Prefix Adder
#### It computers the Cout of K-bit blocks using generate and propagate signals (Ci-1). It is also used to reduce the delay due to the propagation in order to calculate the carry out but it is faster than CLA.
